# Sources and Data

This page will use various types of sources to try and best represent the truth and dispute arguments that misrepresent facts. While I may include some popular science sources or journalism to support a topic, the actual evidence will come from experts, primary sources, and peer-reviewed publications.

## Popular Science

**Popular science** (or pop-science) sources are articles, videos, or images that present science to a general audience. While they can often be supported by evidence and may even reference primary sources or peer-reviewed publications, I will not use pop-science media as facts. Instead, I will sometimes use them to frame a topic, providing an easy-to-understand introduction, explanation, or summary of some more dense evidence. If the message of a pop-science source is contradicted by sufficient evidence, I will not use it.

I might use a pop-science source such as this [video from Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP15q815Saw) to introduce arguments surrounding marijuana legalization, for example.

## Journalism

**Journalism** includes articles and videos produced by the news media. Like pop-science, journalism should utilize primary sources or research, but being connected to a news outlet does not make a source reliable automatically. While there are [ways to determine how news organizations are biased](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=637508&p=4462444), their articles and videos are produced by a wide variety of journalists with varying levels of accountability to the public, and thus will not be used here as definitive evidence on scientific subjects.

When discussing media figures, politics, and current events, I may use a collection of news stories from different sources to support a point, but I will avoid pointing to one source as sole evidence for an issue. For example, if I were discussing the killing of George Floyd, I might point to articles from several sources, including [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/26/862287667/4-police-officers-terminated-after-a-black-man-dies-in-minneapolis-police-custod), [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52861726), and [Fox News](https://www.fox9.com/news/please-please-i-cant-breathe-man-dies-after-being-detained-by-minneapolis-police-fbi-investigating). Citing from any individaul news source is not meant to suggest that it can be trusted, but presenting similar stories from across the spectrum of political bias will be used here to describe events and topics that are not covered in peer-reviewed publications.

Information about finding and interpreting reliable news can be found from the [Center for News Literacy](http://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/what-is-news-literacy/).

## Experts and Organizations

Information from **experts and organizations** can include "letters to the editor" from research journals, articles and presentations from experts, and information released by organizations. These types of sources will be used as supporting evidence, since peer-reviewed research papers can be long and difficult to read. However, I will not take these sources at their word if the primary sources and peer-reviewed research point to different results.

As an example, if I were pointing out that transgender people face widespread discrimination in the US, I might cite this [page from the American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender). While this page has references and may be supported by peer-reviewed research, the source itself is not considered peer-reviewed, so I will not use it as definitive evidence. However, it presents this topic in a short, easy-to-understand manner, so I may use a source like this to support and summarize more substantial evidence.

## Primary Sources

**Primary sources** are videos, recordings, images, or transcripts that document something firsthand. These sources are valuable because they provide direct evidence of an event; however, it is important to keep in mind that the way the evidence is presented can be misleading, so these sources cannot tell the whole story. In order to demonstrate a pattern or trend, a variety of evidence will have to be presented.

Primary sources can be used, for example, when pointing out that President Donald Trump mocked a New York Times reporter's disability in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBe75JekEhA).

## Peer-Reviewed Publications

**Peer-reviewed publications** are research papers that have been reviewed by experts in a field. These sources are often respected in the research community because the research must be approved by others in the field. While a single researcher could publish their findings without peer-review, this research could be deeply biased or flawed. Through the peer-review process, researchers submit their papers to a journal editor, and the editor sends it to experts in the field to be reviewed. While this process is not fool-proof, it is much more likely to ensure unbiased and ethical publications.

For example, when pointing out that the garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean is growing, I might cite [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w). When you visit the publisher's page, you can download the PDF and read the full paper. Articles like these can be found using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), where they are accompanied with useful information such as how many times the paper has been cited by other publications (466 times in the case of my example).

To learn more about peer-reviewed journals and how to find them, check out this [short summary from UC Berkley](https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/howscienceworks_16), or these two library guides from [Walden University](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/library/evaluating/peer-review) and [Angelo State University](https://www.angelo.edu/services/library/handouts/peerrev.php). For a short guide on finding reliable sources in general, check out this [page from the University of Maryland Global Campus](https://sites.umgc.edu/library/libhow/credibility.cfm).

## Bias in Research

It is not enough to just find sources of information; we must always be aware of potential biases in ourselves, our research tools, and the creators, journalists, experts, and researchers we are learning from. In compiling the data and writing this page, I cannot be free of bias. I make a conscious attempt to counteract bias, such as: only using primary and peer-reviewed sources as definitive evidence, seeking news stories from across the political spectrum, and not presenting assumptions that are absent in the evidence. However, the terms that I use to search online and the way I present the information here can and will lead to some misrepresentation. While I will do my best to find and present the facts accurately, I strongly encourage you to read the sources yourself and do your own research while keeping in mind your own biases.

Even if one were to remove all personal bias in the research process, however, the tools used to find information can lead to bias as well. For example, your actions online are stored in "cookies" which influence the content you see throughout the web, as pointed out on this [library guide from the Waterford Institute of Technology](https://wit-ie.libguides.com/c.php?g=652919&p=4581472). This guide discusses a "filter bubble" in which websites tend to provide content that individuals are already likely to agree with, a concept [supported by research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-013-9321-6). The guide points out ways to block cookies and avoid this, but, as the linked research paper points out, the "bubble" is caused by social and psychological factors on these sites as well.

Finally, even if one were to eliminate all personal bias, and even if one were to use completely unbiased tools to find research, bias could still be found [in the research itself](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900086/). In each step of the research process, from data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and publication, there are potential pitfalls that could lead to fatal flaws in the study's conclusions. In the following topics, I may point out some of these biases and flaws in research found in studies that are used to misrepresent the truth, but I encourage you to look out for these issues yourself and examine evidence (including the evidence I cite here) with a critical eye.

## Citing Evidence

When addressing the topics on this page, I will link directly to sources in the text, as I have done in this opening section. At the bottom of this page, you can find a list of sources that are referenced, broken up by section. If you find contradictory evidence, if you notice any errors or biases in my sources that are not addressed, if you find the linked papers to be behind a paywall, or if any of the links become broken, please email [project-koios@protonmail.com](mailto:project-koios@protonmail.com).

### [Sources and Data References](#sources-and-data-1)

# Gender and Sex

## Does transitioning actually work?

**Evidence says yes—gender transition has been proven to increase the well-being and quality of life of those who experience gender dysphoria.**

[A meta-study](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) by the Center for the Study of Inequality at Cornell University did a [systematic review](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/about/selection-methodology/) of peer-reviewed articles from 1991 – 2017 that study the effect of gender transition on well-being. Out of the 4,347 studies found on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), a database from the NIH, 55 were determined to directly address the research question. Out of these, **"51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people,** while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. **We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm."** **Note:** this meta-study is not peer-reviewed, but the collected articles are. Please take a look at some of the individual studies.

[Another meta-study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11154-018-9459-y) from the journal *Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders* found 29 studies that assessed quality of life in the transgender population. The paper concludes that, despite the limitations of existing research, data indicates that **transgender people experience an improved quality of life once they are treated with hormone therapy.**

[A study](https://jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(16)31941-4/fulltext) from the *Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry* evaluated children from 9 – 14 years old who had socially transitioned, and found that they reported **levels of depression and self-worth that were average among their siblings and peers,** with marginally higher anxiety. The paper concludes that "these findings are **in striking contrast to previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially transitioned, which found very high rates of depression and anxiety."**

[A study](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696?source=post_page-----4b76914bba52----------------------) from the journal *Pediatrics* evaluated a group of young transgender people "before the start of puberty suppression," "when cross-sex hormones were introduced," and "at least 1 year after gender reassignment surgery." It found that **"after gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved."**

## Have we seen a recent spike in the transgender population?

**Evidence says yes—more transgender people are being recorded. Importantly, researchers do not claim that this represents a spike in the actual population, and they say it is reasonable that numbers are higher because existing trans individuals feel more comfortable coming out due to greater acceptance and awareness of their identities.**

[This 2017 peer-reviewed study](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303578) in the American Journal of Public Health states the following (emphasis is mine):

"Our meta-regression of US population-based surveys indicated **a substantial annual increase in the number of transgender adults in the United States.** As a consequence, meta-analyses that pool data across several years, including our own, will likely underestimate their numbers. A conservative estimate extrapolating our meta-regression results, while excluding the latest NCHA wave of data as a potential outlier, suggests that **the proportion of transgender adults in the United States is 0.39%**, or 390 per 100 000, and almost 1 million adults nationally. It should be noted that this estimate may be more indicative for younger adults and that national surveys in the near future may observe higher numbers of transgender people. **We speculate that the observed annual increase is not an increase of the true population size, but the result of people feeling freer to report that they are or identify as transgender. This may result from societal changes, such as increased public visibility, awareness, and acceptance of transgender individuals.**"

Similarly, a [letter to the editor](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(19)30930-0/fulltext#%20) in The Journal of Sexual Medicine addresses the fact that, in recent years, gender identity clinics (GICs) have reported more teens who were assigned female at birth. Florence Ashley says that "the shift in ratio has been recuperated by individuals who seek to oppose access to trans care, despite the absense of empirical or strong theoretical grounding for those positions. These theorizations, explaining the shift by reference to social contagion and discomfort with womanhood, assume that it reflects a real change in ratios in the overall trans youth population." She points out that GICs only represent a proportion of trans youth, and "a small sociocultural change—such as greater awareness... that leads to 10% more referrals of trans youth assigned female at birth (AFAB) would nearly double the total GIC population of AFAB youth." She concludes by acknowledging that, while the cause of the change at GICs is unknown, evidence does not prove that this represents a shift in the actual population of trans youth. While this is not a peer-reviewed study, it does cite peer-reviewed sources, and it aligns with the statements from the study mentioned above.

In conclusion, there has been an increase in the recorded population of transgender individuals, specifically AFAB youth, although researchers suggest that this does not represent a true shift in the population. Because there are no conclusive studies on *why* these recorded shifts are occuring, I would encourage you to view these speculations not as definitive answers, but as alternatives to the unfounded assumption that social pressure is causing new cases of gender dysphoria.

## Can minors recieve gender-affirming medical treatment without oversight?

**Evidence says not likely. While laws in some areas could allow minors to recieve treatments without the approval of parents or mental health professionals, there are many barriers in reality (most of which are endorsed by leading transgender health organizations).**

The [World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)](https://www.wpath.org/) is a non-profit organization whose goal is "to promote evidence based care, education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health." WPATH publishes the [*Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People*](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/Standards%20of%20Care_V7%20Full%20Book_English.pdf), which informs transgender medical care around the world.

While a letter from a mental health professional was traditionally required before undergoing hormone therapy, this seventh version of the Standards of Care (SOC) recognizes ["informed consent"](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/informed-consent) as a valid precursor as well. This means that medical professionals can begin treatment if they explain the risks and benefits of hormone therapy, and only if they believe their patient has a clear understanding of these factors. In any case, doctors are not *required* to give their patients medication or treatment of any sort, a right [protected by the US government](https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/conscience-protections/index.html).

While some medical professionals [do require referral letters](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/pst-0000034.pdf) for hormone therapy, others do not, and you can read about personal experiences with this informed consent process [here](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/01/how-planned-parenthood-helps-transgender-patients-get-hormone-therapy.html). When it comes to surgery, however, the SOC says that chest surgery should require one referral from a mental health professional, and genital surgery should require two independent referrals. Proof that the patient has undergone at least a year of hormone therapy is recommended for chest surgeries and listed as a requirement for genital surgeries. For genital surgeries, the SOC lists "12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity" and being the legal age of majority ([which is 18+ in most places, including the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority)) as part of the criteria as well.

While the SOC emphasizes that genital surgery should only occur at the legal age of majority, and it recommends parental approval for chest surgery and hormone treatment, [the age of medical consent in the US](https://www.freelists.org/archives/hilac/02-2014/pdftRo8tw89mb.pdf) varies by state, and medical consent is complicated by the fact that federal law can sometimes override state law.

Regardless, there is a difference between possibility and practicality, as pointed out in this [news coverage from Oregon](https://www.koin.com/news/headline-irrational-on-oregon-transgender-coverage/). As the Oregon Health Authority points out in their statement, patients must still "demonstrate the capacity to make a fully formed decision and to give consent to treatment, regardless of age," and "nothing in Oregon law requires a health care provider to provide medical services to a minor." They go on to say that "in most cases, providers will encourage (and in some cases require) family engagement."

Additonally, insurance policies that cover gender-affirmation treatments ([see here](https://www.hrc.org/resources/finding-insurance-for-transgender-related-healthcare)) largely align with the WPATH's Standards of Care, meaning that, even if a minor were to find a doctor willing to give them treatment without parental oversight, their insurance plan (that they access through their parents) would require the guidelines mentioned above to be met before covering the cost. The alternative would be for the minor to pay for treatment themself.

In conclusion, widely-adopted medical guidelines for hormone therapy and gender-confirmation surgery place restrictions on treatment for minors that—when combined with the age of consent, the judgement of medical professionals, the requirements of insurance coverage, and the cost of treatment—make it virtually impossible for a minor to receive gender-affirmation treatments without oversight.

## Is transgender hormone therapy untested or experimental?

**Evidence says no—gender-affirming hormone therapy has been thoroughly studied and approved.**

The Scientific American's ["A History of Transgender Health Care"](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/a-history-of-transgender-health-care/) describes that German scientist Magnus Hirschfeld pioneered gender-affirming treatments and founded the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, which was founded over a century ago. The article goes on to describe the world's long history of transgender treatment over the past hundred years, and I encourage you check it out.

When looking at hormone therapy documented in peer-reviewed journals, this [review of the literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5182227/) from *Translational Andrology and Urology* documents an **extensive and thorough history of research,** and points out that "cross-sex hormone therapy has been shown to have positive physical and psychological effects on the transitioning individual and is considered a mainstay treatment for many patients." There are risks to hormone therapy, as there are with any medication, but the review repeatedly points out that **hormone the therapy medications used are approved by the FDA,** meaning that ["the agency has determined that the benefits of the product outweigh the known risks for the intended use."](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/it-really-fda-approved)

For more specific research looking at the effects of hormone therapy, please check out one of the dozens of studies mentioned in the review above, and see questions such as [Does transitioning actually work?](#does-transitioning-actually-work) and [Do transgender people often regret transitioning?](#do-transgender-people-often-regret-transitioning)

## Do transgender people often regret transitioning?

**Evidence says no—the rates of regret or de-transition are lower than 5%. Among children who experience gender dysphoria, the rate is less clear, but there is no evidence to prove that the majority of trans-identifying children and adolescents later identify as cisgender.**

[This study](https://jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(13)00187-1/fulltext) (with 343 citations on Google Scholar at the time of writing) is commonly referred to as evidence that desistance (when people who previously identified as transgender later identify as cisgender) is a widespread problem. The study looked at 127 adolescents from the only gender clinic in the Netherlands, and it concluded that 80 (63%) of the teens desisted. However, 28 of these 80 never responded to a follow-up questionnaire to indicate a presence or lack of gender dysphoria. Additionally, 55% of those who desisted had a "subthreshold diagnosis" for gender dysphoria in the first place, meaning they were not assessed to officially have gender dysphoria. This is in contrast with the persisters, of which only 6.3% were subthreshold. The study essentially looked at 80 adolescents with gender dysphoria, along with 47 without gender dysphoria, and found that 52 of the participants did not identify as trans at the end of the study, while 28 did not respond to the questionnaire. Though the 28 non-responders lead to the full desistance being unknown, an increase of 5 teens not experiencing gender dysphoria (out of 127) is much less significant than the 63% statistic indicates.

Regardless, let's look at some other studies. [This study from The Journal of Sexual Medicine](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(18)30057-2/fulltext#sec3.3) was conducted by the same clinic in the Netherlands studied above. It compiled medical records from 1972 – 2015 and found that only 1.9% of adolescents who started puberty suppression did not go on to request hormone therapy, and that **"regret was identified in 0.6% of transwomen and 0.3% of transmen" who had their ovaries or testes removed.**

A [fifty-year survey of transgender people in Sweden](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-014-0300-8) published in *Archives of Sexual Behavior* found that, **out of 681 individuals who received a new legal gender, 15 (2.2%) of them applied for a reversal.**

Finally, in [The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf), 8% of the respondents reported that they "had de-transitioned temporarily or permanently at some point," and 62% of those who de-transitioned only did so temporarily and "were currently living full time in a gender different than the one they were thought to be at birth." This results in a **3.04% rate of permanent de-transition.** The survey found that the reasons behind de-transitioning included "facing too much harassment or discrimination after they began transitioning (31%), having trouble getting a job (29%), or pressure from a parent (36%), spouse (18%), or other family members (26%)."

## Is gender dysphoria socially contagious?

**Evidence does not support this. There is no valid evidence demonstrating that gender dysphoria is a result of social contagion.**

### Background

Here are some examples of people referring to social contagion and "rapid onset gender dysphoria" as an issue: [J.K. Rowling](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/), [Abigail Shrier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtftWcgXjdg)

Both examples provided, as well as other sources that cite rapid onset gender dysphoria, are referring to the study published by Dr. Lisa Littman, the researcher who coined the term. Her paper, [**Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330), proposes that there may be a trend of young people experiencing gender dysphoria due to social pressure and other external factors. To quote the paper's conclusion: "Emerging hypotheses include the possibility of a potential new subcategory of gender dysphoria (referred to as rapid-onset gender dysphoria) that has not yet been clinically validated and the possibility of social influences and maladaptive coping mechanisms contributing to the development of gender dysphoria." Given the fact that this study concludes by suggesting that there are *hypotheses* that have a *possibility* of a *potential* phenomenon that *has not yet been clinically validated*, and there is a *possibility* that it is due to social pressures, it is deceptive when supporters of these ideas present them as facts that are unambigiously supported by a peer-reviewed publication.

In her conclusion, Littman goes on to say: "Parent-child conflict may also contribute to the course of the dysphoria. More research that includes data collection from [adolescents and young adults], parents, clinicians and third party informants is needed to further explore the roles of social influence, maladaptive coping mechanisms, parental approaches, and family dynamics in the development and duration of gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults." This is crucial, because it acknowledges that other research is required to determine how gender dysphoria manifests and affects young people. Again, representing this study as conclusive evidence of a widespread issue is disingenuous when those claims are dismissed in the final sentence of the paper itself.

While Littman's remarks in this study are clear that the evidence presented is anything but decisive, her study "caused a furore," as J.K. Rowling wrote, referring to the [controversy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-4685597) that ensued after the paper's publication (more coverage of the controversy can be found in [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/new-paper-ignites-storm-over-whether-teens-experience-rapid-onset-transgender-identity) and [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/brown-u-censors-gender-dysphoria-study-worried-that-findings-might-invalidate-the-perspectives-of-transgender-community)). Additionally, a former Harvard dean [addressed the controversy](https://quillette.com/2018/08/31/as-a-former-dean-of-harvard-medical-school-i-question-browns-failure-to-defend-lisa-littman/) and criticized Brown University for deleting their promotion of Littman's paper.

### Criticism

While PLOS ONE, the journal that published this paper, does have a peer-review process, flaws in this process have been pointed out by [some in the media](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/06/30/predatory-journals/?sh=318a40e055d6), and [a peer-reviewed paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157718302724).

The paper itself has been criticized by other academics in [articles](https://theconversation.com/why-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-is-bad-science-92742), [public statements](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Public%20Policies/2018/9_Sept/WPATH%20Position%20on%20Rapid-Onset%20Gender%20Dysphoria_9-4-2018.pdf), and, again, in peer-reviewed papers published in journals such as [The Sociological Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0038026120934693) and [Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-019-1453-2). In response to the latter paper, three researchers wrote a [letter to the editor](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10508-019-01517-9?author_access_token=sV1x8HKbegOcrAPUaDyELPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7Qt5kJQq2-9M3weJ6DneKBtAtsVkiheShdsyxBMNjudT7lp-JJHUKFJbJUwb1074sltiDaC35S0jSTUCoukRnT2AEAgw9wN9_P7sLFiJ5Vig%3D%3D), in order to voice their support of Littman and her research.

[This article from Dr. Florence Ashley](https://psychcentral.com/lib/there-is-no-evidence-that-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-exists/), the author of the paper in The Sociological Review mentioned above, neatly summarizes the issues pointed out in the aforementioned peer-reviewed journals. However, **here are some main points about the study's data collection:**

1. **The surveys evaluated parents rather than the children experiencing dysphoria.** While there are reasons to gather information from parents of children experiencing gender dysphoria, in no way is this sufficient to determine social contagion. The children themselves are the ones who are experiencing the gender dysphoria, as well as any pressures the researcher asserts may influence it. This point becomes more crucial when combined with the next two, which point to a heavily biased selection of parents.

2. **Three out of four of the websites used to recruit participants are known for being critical and/or skeptical of trans identities.** The study recruited from:
- **[4thwavenow](https://4thwavenow.com/)**, described in the paper as a "safe place for gender-skeptical parents and their allies"
- **[Transgendertrend](https://www.transgendertrend.com/)**, described in the paper as a group of parents who are "concerned about the current trend to diagnose ‘gender non-conforming’ children as transgender"
- **[Youth trans critical professionals](https://youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org/)**, a members only site described in the paper as a group who are "concerned about the current trend to quickly diagnose and affirm young people as transgender"
- **[Parents of transgender children](https://www.facebook.com/groups/108151199217727/)**, a private Facebook group the paper says is "considered to be a site to find parents who are supportive of their child’s gender identity"

According to the study, around three out of four (76.5%) of the parents responding in the survey "felt that their child was incorrect in their belief of being transgender."

3. **The data collected has a [self-selection bias](https://dictionary.apa.org/self-selection-bias)**, meaning that the methods used to recruit participants for the survey resluted in a non-random distribution. The survey states at the beginning:

"Online, more than 20 individual parent accounts have described seeing their child develop a rapid onset of gender dysphoria beginning in adolescence in the context of increased social media/Internet use and/or being part of a peer group in which one or multiple friends have developed gender dysphoria and come out as transgender during a similar time frame. Several parents have described situations where entire friend groups became gender dysphoric."

The presence of social contaigon is not a requirement for survey participants, so mentioning this hypothesis up-front is unnecessary. This, in effect, may make parents of trans children who have observed ***the phenomenon the researcher hypothesizes is common*** more likely to think they are good candidates for the survey compared to parents who have trans children who are not in these conditions, and it may prompt participants to interpret their child's behavior through this lens when responding to the questions, ***therefore making the phenomenon appear more common.***

### Correction and Republication

After controversy and criticism, PLOS ONE issued a correction and republished the study with the new title [**Parent reports of adolescents and young adults perceived to show signs of a rapid onset of gender dysphoria**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214157), and in [an interview with Littman following the republication](https://quillette.com/2019/03/19/an-interview-with-lisa-littman-who-coined-the-term-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria/) she said she was "very pleased with the final product." While none of the results of the study were changed, context was added to address many of the limitations mentioned above, as well as clarification for those who may view the study as definitive, such as "emphasis that this is a study of parental observations which serves to develop hypotheses."

Importantly, the correction includes the admission of the possibility that the study may merely be describing adolescent-onset or late-onset gender dysphoria, a phenomenon that is already documented. In fact, the [Mayo Clinic's gender dysphoria page](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255) says the following: "Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood (early onset). Or, you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria followed by a recurrence of gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life (late onset)."

### Conclusion

[Practically the entire collection of prominent papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=social+contagion+gender+dysphoria&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44) which address the question of socially contagious gender dysphoria, aside from Littman's study, are responses to her study. I have addressed the many reasons that Littman's research does not prove social contagion or rapid onset gender dysphoria, and I can find no other studies concluding that this phenomenon does indeed exist.

Finally, references to social contagion when it comes to gender dysphoria tend to come up in arguments suggesting that access to gender-affirming treatment has gone too far. To understand why this claim does not hold up, see the topics above, such as [Do transgender people often regret transitioning?](#do-transgender-people-often-regret-transitioning) and [Can minors recieve gender-affirming medical treatment without oversight?](#can-minors-recieve-gender-affirming-medical-treatment-without-oversight)

### A Note About Suppression

J.K. Rowling's statement that "as a much-banned author," she is worried about trans activism in part because of "freedom of speech" is starkly contrasted with the fact that she is the author of [the world's best-selling book series](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/best-selling-book-series.html) and she tweeted her views about new trans activism to her [millions of Twitter followers](https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-jk-rowling-promotes-anti-transgender-transphobic-online-store-20200923-djcpmbnslfb7xbggsdac4mznpq-story.html) (14.2 million at the time of writing).

Similarly, in Joe Rogan's interview of Abigail Shrier, he claimed that "unless you are 100% in support of their decision and their rights, and you celebrate them, you're gonna get in real trouble." While Rogan has been criticized by the media for his statements about trans people in the past (e.g. [here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1573044-ufc-joe-rogan-to-transgender-mma-fighter-fallon-fox-youre-a-man) and [here](https://www.insider.com/joe-rogan-suggests-caitlyn-jenner-is-trans-because-of-kardashians-2020-9)), he continues to have [one of the top podcasts on Apple Podcasts](https://chartable.com/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience). Shrier, a writer for the Wall Street Journal ([one of the most widely-circulated newspapers in the US](https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/)) echoed his concerns, stating that "that's why we have this problem; because nobody will talk about it," while promoting her book on one of the world's most popular podcasts.

As a relevant note, the fourth most popular podcast on Apple podcasts at time of writing is hosted by Ben Shapiro, a man who [challenges the validity of trans identities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkONHNXGfaM) and founded the Daily Wire, a conservative news site that is [one of Facebook's most popular publishers](https://www.newsweek.com/daily-wire-conservative-media-surge-facebook-americans-turn-pandemic-protests-1527894). In summary, people who have criticized the trans community retain large platforms, despite the [growing support for transgender rights](https://www.prri.org/research/americas-growing-support-for-transgender-rights/), and the claim that they are suppressed or unrepresented is contradicted by evidence.

In a future update to this page, I plan to add a topic that covers media issues in more depth; however, it is important to address here because it is part of how people in the media misrepresent their ideas. If one can be convinced that there is an effort to suppress the views of people who criticize the trans community, they may be more likely to accept claims with insufficient evidence, because the implication is that there is more evidence being withheld somewhere.
